        <h3 style="text-align: center;">About me</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; padding: 2px;">I am currently a student working on programming projects since I am 9 years old. Back then I was learning HTML with a good friend of mine. We were trying to sell those websites we made but with fairly little success.
            Around 4 years ago I stumbled across Python. And I imediatly fell in love with it. Later 2015 I was impressed by the Google Assistant. I wanted to build something similar to that. So that was the point when I started with Machine and Deep Learning.
            So I have been doing that since then in my free time besides school.Back then I was starting with the at the time fairly complicated Tensorflow(at least for a newbie). Ever since I made different models for computer vision and natural language Processing.
            Nowadays I am working on a fairly simple and easy to understand self driving car. In the future I want to keep working on the model and advancing it. My end goal is to write a paper about it. Also on the side 
            I got into quantitative finance with zipline and backtesting investment models.</p>
